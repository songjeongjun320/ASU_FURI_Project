Current logic = if clear variance > 100, save the img
if 3 imgs detected, stop

But it should be change, 
if clear variance is larger than previous one, 
select that one and send it to textract

1. change plots.py "is_clear" func
2. change the logic, only remember the pic address which has max clear_variance.
    - because the current logic is not the best logic.
3. send to textract
